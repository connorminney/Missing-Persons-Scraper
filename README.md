# Missing-Persons-Scraper
Make sure you have chromedriver installed!!! This is script that is used to pull demographic information for victims in missing persons/cold cases from online databases (namus.gov and projectcoldcase.org). The goal is to make this information more accessible for anyone with an interest in applying data analytics/science to identify trends and prevent future disappearances.
